# 2. References

Before computing the free energies of Na in the multithermal-multibaric ensemble we calculate references in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. This directory contains an example at 1 bar and 350 K of the calculation of the free energy difference between the liquid and the solid. The folders Pressure1bar and Pressure10000bar contain the results of the calculations.
